Authorized Keywords Search on Encrypted Data
This project implements a secure data management system that allows authorized users to perform keyword-based searches on encrypted data while ensuring time-controlled keyword privacy. The system enhances security by reducing keyword exposure duration and minimizing potential data breaches.

Features
✅ AES Encryption – Encrypts data before storing it.

✅ Authorized Keyword Search – Only permitted users can search specific keywords.

✅ Time-Controlled Access – Limits keyword search access to a predefined duration.

✅ Security Enhancement – Reduces unauthorized keyword exposure, minimizing breach risks.

Technologies Used
Python – Core programming language
PyCryptodome (AES Encryption) – Secure data encryption
Flask (Optional) – For building a simple API-based search system
SQLite / MongoDB – Database for encrypted data storage
