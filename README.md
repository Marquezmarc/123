Authorized Keywords Search on Encrypted Data
This project implements a secure data management system that allows authorized users to perform keyword-based searches on encrypted data while ensuring time-controlled keyword privacy. The system enhances security by reducing keyword exposure duration and minimizing potential data breaches.

Features
âœ… AES Encryption â€“ Encrypts data before storing it.

âœ… Authorized Keyword Search â€“ Only permitted users can search specific keywords.

âœ… Time-Controlled Access â€“ Limits keyword search access to a predefined duration.

âœ… Security Enhancement â€“ Reduces unauthorized keyword exposure, minimizing breach risks.

Technologies Used
Python â€“ Core programming language
PyCryptodome (AES Encryption) â€“ Secure data encryption
Flask (Optional) â€“ For building a simple API-based search system
SQLite / MongoDB â€“ Database for encrypted data storage

Security Benefits
ðŸ”¹ Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data.
ðŸ”¹ Limits keyword exposure duration, reducing the risk of attacks.
ðŸ”¹ Ensures data confidentiality even during searches.
